  bio: I'm currently wrapping up a postdoctoral research position at Cleveland Clinic, before starting in the Fall as an Assistant Professor in computer science at Michigan State University. I use digital systems to study eco-evolutionary dynamics at broad spatiotemporal scales. Like most ecologists, I'm fascinated by the vast diversity of life that coexists on our planet. Understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate and maintain this diversity is important both for biology and for machine learning via evolutionary computation. My formal training is in Computer Science, Evolutionary Biology, and Ecology.

  bio: Hello! I just finished the second year of my PhD at Michigan State University studying computer science and evolution. I use computational models to study how "living" organisms adapt to information from their environment. This includes evolution at the population level, but also learning and plasticity at the organism level. In my free time I enjoy experiencing the natural world (e.g., hiking, camping, cycling, and keeping plants) and also the synthetic (e.g., making / playing video games)!

  bio: I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Integrative Biology at Michigan State University. I'm co-advised by Dr. Emily Dolson and Dr. Elise Zipkin, meaning that I work with computational statistical ecologists despite no formal training in (1) computation, (2) statistics, or (3) ecology. That said, I'm really interested in genetic complexity and how we can measure it using tools from different disciplines! I'm also passionate about undergraduate interdisciplinary pedagogy. Outside academia I enjoy games (board, video) and cats (the small, indoor kind).

    I'm a teaching faculty member in the Biological Sciences program at MSU, and involved in several research projects over the summer.  Most relevant to the WAVES workshop is my work with Avida-ED.  My pedagogical research is most focused on what factors influence student learning about natural selection and evolution, and how students understand the concept of randomness.  I am also investigating whether different types of students have predictably different misconceptions prior to instruction.  My basic science research focuses on questions of the evolutionary process: How predictable is evolution?  How repeatable are the patterns?  And how well do patterns generalize across different study systems?  I use both computational and wetlab experiments to address these topics in the context of experimental evolution.

  bio: I'm a fifth year PhD student working with Dr. Charles Ofria in Computer Science and Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, & Behavior at Michigan State University. My research resides somewhere at the intersection of artificial life, evolutionary biology, and evolutionary computation. I use self-replicating computer programs as a model organism for studying the dynamics of evolving systems, and I draw inspiration from natural evolution to develop new evolutionary computation techniques and representations. Outside of academia, I enjoy tabletop gaming and un-athletically playing frisbee and soccer.

  bio: I am a Professor of Computer Science at Michigan State University, as well as Director of the Digital Evolution Laboratory, Director of the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, and President of the International Society for Artificial Life.  My core interests have to do with understanding the evolution of complex traits, behaviors, and functions, especially the evolution of intelligence.  In nature, adaptive evolution relies on many different processes, stemming from information-rich environments with multi-scale spatial and temporal dynamics that generate complex ecologies including both cooperative and competative co-evolutionary pressures.  Ultimately these dynamics lead to open-ended evolution, where major evolutionary transitions can produce whole new type of organisms. Many of these processes can be replicated in a computer, both to understand their role in natural evolution and to harness them for problem solving.  In my lab we conduct projects to study these topics, as well as to make this research accessible to a broad range of student and public audiences.

  bio: Uma Sethuraman is a sophomore computer science major, with a minor in business, at the University of Texas at Austin. After taking her first computer science course in ninth grade, Uma saw how computer science could solve a single problem in so many different ways. Uma became the president of her high school’s Girls in Computing Club and a coach for the Computer Science Club. In high school, she also created a genetic algorithm to address the problem of high school class scheduling. With this project, she won the Oracle Academy First Award at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. For Uma, exploring and finding solutions to computer science problems provides a feeling of achievement like no other. In college, Uma volunteered with a nonprofit organization to develop their iOS and Android apps. She has also taught elementary and middle school students about computer science through university organizations like Women in Computer Science. In the future, she aspires to apply the skills that she has learned in her coursework and projects to engineer software and algorithms that can solve real-world problems. In her free time, Uma also likes to cook and dance.

    I am the programmer for Avida-ED at MSU. I have an eclectic background in Biology & Engineering with BS degrees in EE & Zoology from U of FL, MS in Biomedical Engineering from UT Arlington, & a PhD in Wildlife & Fisheries Science from Texas A&M.

    While working at Florida's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, I wrote the EcoSpecies web application for the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council (SAFMC), and was the programmer for the Harmful Algal Bloom research group there.

    I examined the effects of noise associated with natural gas extraction on lekking sage grouse including sound propagation/vegetation/topology maps from drilling sites during my Post-Doc at UC Davis.

    For my PhD, I wrote software analyzing response times of bottlenose dolphins and beluga whales during Temporary Threshold Shift Hearing Tests at the Navy Marine Mammal Lab. The dolphin audiogram includes hearing up to 180 kHz, which is the highest frequency that had been tested due to hydrophone limitations. In another project, we recorded click vocalizations from 100 Hz to over 1 MHz and found significant sound components up to 500 kHz, which even if the dolphin does not hear frequencies that high, is useful information in modeling bottlenose dolphin click production - something that man-made projectors cannot produce.

    I wrote software & compared surgical vs non-surgical treatment of human jaw fractures for my MS thesis, including a graphical user interface for an MS-DOS application.

    I worked for General Dynamics on test stations to test flight computers and fire-control computers (weapons) on F-16 fighter jets. I also study G-induced loss of consciousness, both visual and auditory displays for pilot-vehicle interface advanced cockpit design.

    I have been a licensed falconer since 1982 and currently fly a Harris Hawk that I trapped in December of 1991. We added a vizsla to the hunting 'pack' in 1993 and have been flying Harris Hawks over vizslas since then.

    I worked caring for neonate horses (and one camel) a the U of FL College of Veterinary Medicine. I have trained horses from weanling foals thru driving with a 2 wheel cart or riding up to 1st level dressage and novice level eventing.

    I am a certified SCUBA diver and also worked as a hyperbaric chamber attendant at the NASA on-call hyperbaric facility in Shands Hospital, Gainesville, Florida.
