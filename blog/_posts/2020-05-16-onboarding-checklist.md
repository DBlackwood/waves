## Workshop Communication

We will be using [Slack messaging](https://slack.com/) to make workshop announcements, for group discussion, and to message with mentors.

We will be using [Zoom videoconferencing](https://zoom.us/) for "face-to-face" get togethers.
Group meetings will be held in a dedicated Zoom room, which you can access [here](https://mmore500.com/hopto/ar).

## Onboarding Surveys

We put together a Google Form to collect information that will be used coordinate the workshop and assess its effectiveness.
We included several demographic questions in this survey.
Demographic information is collected solely to internally assess the diversity and equity of our the workshop.
You are not required to answer any demographics questions.

:soon: Please fill out our onboarding survey [here](https://mmore500.com/hopto/aq).

To the best of your ability, please keep weekdays from 1pm to 4pm EST clear on you calendars so that we can find meeting times that work for as much of the group as possible.

:soon: If you do have a critical obligation that falls between 1pm and 4pm EST on weekdays and cannot be rescheduled, please fill out [this WhenIsGood](https://mmore500.com/hopto/as) to let us know.
Briefly describe your obligation in the comment.
Otherwise, there's no need to fill out this WhenIsGood.

Michgan State University requests that we refer undergraduate students working in summer positions to the Undergraduate Research Office.
They collect information that allows them to assess undergraduate research across the institution and to coordinate professional development activities.

:soon: If you are a current or recent undergraduate student, please complete their survey [here](https://mmore500.com/hopto/au).

## Stipend Setup

Stipend checks will be disbursed bi-weekly by mail.
The dates that stipend checks will be mailed are listed on the [workshop schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule).

You can send your completed form by email to [will3360@msu.edu](mailto:will3360@msu.edu).
If would prefer to submit the form by snail mail, contact her by email for instructions.

:bangbang: If the address you would like your stipend checks delivered to differs from the permanent address you listed in your W-9 form, be sure to let Melissa know.

## Workshop Resources

We have assembled a listing of web resources related to the workshop [elsewhere on the site]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources).
If you would feel more comfortable brushing up on your C++ or evolution background before the workshop gets underway, feel free to click over there and check some of them out.
If you have ideas for what you'd like to see on there, feel free to [open a PR](https://github.com/mmore500/waves) or shoot me a message!

## Next Steps

:soon: If you haven't marked your calendars for our first orientation meeting, be sure to do so!
It will take place Tuesday, May 26 from 1pm to 4pm in the WAVES Zoom Room.

We assigned initial mentors to participants based on match between mentors' projects and applicants' statements and resumes.
These assignments may shift as participants choose which projects interest them most, but they should at least be a good start.
Keep an eye out for an email from them in the next few days!
