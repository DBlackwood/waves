## Pre-Class Learning Material

* [CppCon 2017: Kate Gregory “10 Core Guidelines You Need to Start Using Now”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkDEzfpdcSg)
* [C++ Code Smells - Jason Turner - code::dive 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgTFO1D3bSU)
   * watch the first twelve minutes to get the gist
* [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
   * there's *a lot* of text in the core guidelines
   * try to browse through the [interfaces subsection](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-interfaces), focusing on "Reason" and "Example" for each guideline

## Conversation Starters/Discussion Questions

1. Which is more intuitive or easier to pick up: patterns or antipatterns? is it important to be familiar with both?
2. With so many guidelines/best practices, what are effective strategies to try to familiarize yourself with them? To what extent is it necessary to learn by doing?
3. Are guidelines that aren't concrete enough to be automatically refereed practical?
4. To what extent should we/is it effective to argue "because the guidelines say so" about a coding decision (instead of a deeper reason)?
5. What guidelines or terminology were most difficult to understand or most unfamiliar?
6. Do you disagree with any of the guidelines mentioned?
