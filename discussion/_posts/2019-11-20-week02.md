## Pre-Class Learning Material

* [CppCon 2015: Herb Sutter "Writing Good C++14... By Default"](https://youtu.be/hEx5DNLWGgA?t=1476)
   * pointer lifetime issues (the relevant part starts at 24:30)
* [CppCon 2016: Herb Sutter “Leak-Freedom in C++... By Default.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfmTagWcqoE)
   * memory management

I would recommend watching both as they are related.
Obviously, come with things you don't fully understand or want more clarification on, but also it would be fun to discuss things y'all disagree with.
