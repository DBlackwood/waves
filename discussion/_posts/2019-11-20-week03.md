## Pre-Class Learning Material

* [CppCon 2018: Jonathan Boccara “105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2olsGf6JIkU)
* [GoingNative 2013: Sean Parent "C++ Seasoning"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2tWOdzgXHA) (first 33 minutes)

## Conversation Starters/Discussion Questions

1. Which of the algorithms did you learn about for the first time that you found useful/surprising?
2. Can you bring a sample of your favorite STL algorithm usage, something you find either beautiful or really helpful?
