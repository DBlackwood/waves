## Pre-Class Learning Material

* [CppCon 2019: Miro Knejp “Non-conforming C++: the Secrets the Committee Is Hiding From You”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAdLwUXRUvg)
* [CppCon 2019: Timur Doumler “C++20: The small things”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb6u8BrfHjw) (watch first 8 minutes, although the rest is encouraged & we will likely return to this topic in future weeks)

## Conversation Starters/Discussion Questions

1. Would you use any of these non-conforming secrets in your own code? If so, which ones?
2. What do you think of the committee's choices in choosing simplicity over flexibility/C compatibility in standardizing designated initializers? How does the wide presence of non-standard extensions in compilers affect the rationale behind this decision?
