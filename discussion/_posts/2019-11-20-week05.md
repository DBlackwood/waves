## Pre-Class Learning Material

* [CppCon 2019: David Olsen “Faster Code Through Parallelism on CPUs and GPUs”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbbKEAWf1ow)

If, after watching that, you think "my god how do I get in on these c++ 17 parallel algorithms", have no fear...
* [CppCon 2016: Bryce Adelstein Lelbach “The C++17 Parallel Algorithms Library and Beyond"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vck6kzWjY88) (optional)

## Conversation Starters/Discussion Questions

1. Why are parallel max, min, and inner product hard?  Can they run with linear speedups in terms of cpus/gpus?
2. How can we use caching and spacial locality to improve parallel algorithms?
3. How important is legibility versus speed for industry code?
4. How much should you optimize code for a certain platform, given that such optimizations would cause performance decreases on other platforms?
