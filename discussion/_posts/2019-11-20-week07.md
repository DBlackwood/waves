title: "Week 7: Compiler Optimizations"

## Pre-Class Learning Material

The first video is a broad discussion of things the compiler tries to optimize automatically and ways to write code utilizing this.
* [CppCon 2018: Nir Friedman “Understanding Optimizers: Helping the Compiler Help You”](https://youtu.be/8nyq8SNUTSc)

The second gives specific examples of some compiler switches and what they do.
* [CppCon 2016: Tim Haines “Improving Performance Through Compiler Switches..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Z4JlMJ1VQ&feature=youtu.be&t=420)

(Just the portion from 7:00 - 33:00. The rest of the video shows some interesting benchmarking examples, but isn't necessary to get the general idea of the talk.)

Found the following in perusing through some compiler optimization settings, thought it might also be helpful. By godbolt no less. https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3372264
