## Pre-Class Learning Material

* [CppCon 2019: Fedor Pikus “C++ Design Patterns: From C++03 to C++17”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdtYi0vvct0)

I also highly recommend watching the Godbolt talk that Nitash sent on Friday since it will allow us to expand on our discussion, but it's not required.

## Conversation Starters/Discussion Questions

- Are there any variations on design patterns that you regularly use that are unique to C++ features/perks?
- Which C++20 features could open the door to new variations on existing design patterns?
- What are some strategies to deal with performance trade-offs when considering different design paradigms?
