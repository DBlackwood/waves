## Pre-Class Learning Material

After watching waaay too many talks on template metaprogramming, I think this one is a good choice to start some good discussion:
* [CppCon 2015: Fedor Pikus “C++ Metaprogramming: Journey from simple to insanity and back"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZi6QqZSbFg)
* [quick-bench](https://quick-bench.com) reproduction of the Pow profiling result reported in the talk: [O1](http://quick-bench.com/Y6r8uXvWwKTMOrRBHHMhMys1vbM) and [O3](http://quick-bench.com/NTMxl76cZadZ2THCeX02On86-9U)

Nitash has some good suggestions below.
What I really came out of this understanding is just how hard modern C++ compilers have been working to simplify and eliminate the need for meta programming.
One big help is fold expressions.
Let's also watch this short (<8 minute) summary of them:
* [C++ Weekly - Ep 20 C++17's Fold Expressions - Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhk8pF_SlTk)

optional extra material...

For those of you who want something more (NOT required!) here is Herb Sutter talking about how to replace template meta programming with more sensible alternatives:
* [CppCon 2017: Herb Sutter “Meta: Thoughts on generative C++”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhk8pF_SlTk)

A [brief, example-driven primer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/sfinae.pdf) on using SFINAE to test for the presence of a member function in a struct contributed by [@cgnitash](https://github.com/cgnitash).
(Find the example code all spliced together on Compiler Explorer [here](https://godbolt.org/z/XbTrB8)).

Also, reccomended by [@cgnitash](https://github.com/cgnitash): [CppCon 2014: Walter E. Brown "Modern Template Metaprogramming: A Compendium, Part I"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am2is2QCvxY).
