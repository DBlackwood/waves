## Pre-Class Learning Material

A good overview of C++ modules.
It's a bit on the long side, but covers a lot of ground and is the most clear and well organized out of the module talks I was able to find.
* [Core C++ 2019 :: Bryce Adelstein :: Modules are Coming](https://youtu.be/bDTm6y6fNSU)

Extra if interested...
Also a good talk, but more narrowly focused on building/compiling modules.
* [CppCon 2019: Michael Spencer “Building Modules”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0SHHkBenss)


## Conversation Starters/Discussion Questions

1. benefits of modules
2. problems with switching over to modules
3. anything you didn't understand about modules (in the video or otherwise)
4. bigger picture impact
  * how does this change c++?
  * ...how we write/think about c++?
