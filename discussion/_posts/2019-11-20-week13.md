## Pre-Class Learning Material

1. [CppCon 2019: Klaus Iglberger “Back to Basics: Move Semantics (part 1 of 2)”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St0MNEU5b0o)
* covers r- and l-value references, move constructor and assignment operator
2. [CppCon 2019: Klaus Iglberger “Back to Basics: Move Semantics (part 2 of 2)”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIzaZbKUw2s)
* reccomended: first half hour (discusses forwarding references)
* optional: second half hour, which has some tricky exercises
  * these might be fun to talk through in class (feel free to watch ahead of time!)

These talks were part of a "Back to Basics" series at CppCon 2019, many of which I have enjoyed.
It's worth searching CppCon 2019 Back to Basics up on YouTube and perusing them!

## Conversation Starters/Discussion Questions

1. What (????) does this code snippet even do?
(I checked, it compiles.)
   ```
   std::string s{"hi"};
   s + s = s;
   ```
2. What are the plusses and minuses of using 
   ```
   ...
   , pi( std::move(w.pi) )
   { w.pi = nullptr }
   ...
   ```
   versus
   ```
   ... ,pi( std::exchange(w.pi, nullptr))
   ```
 3. Why is it important to make move constructors and move assignment operators noexcept?
 4. What is `std::swap` and how does it relate to moving?
 5. What is the point of a function with a const return object (e.g., `const Widget getWidget();`)?
 When (if ever) would this be useful?
 6. Do you have any obervations/comments or questions about the giant "Paramater Conventions" table at [53:43](https://youtu.be/St0MNEU5b0o?t=3223)?
