# Call for Participants

We are looking to recruit five to ten early-career participants for a ten-week, funded, full-time, fully-remote software development workshop during the summer of 2020.

The goal of the workshop is four-fold:
1. to help participants advance their careers by skillbuilding through hands-on C++ and/or JavaScript software development in an academic setting,
2. to catalyze effective science communication and science pedagogy by helping participants develop the know-how to showcase their research through interactive web applications,
3. to jumpstart software development on web framework and core digital evolution tools in support of the next version of the Avida-ED scientific and educational software, and
4. to yield software that broadly enriches the digital evolution, scientific, education, and open-source communities.

This workshop is organized in conjunction with the [Avida-ED project](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/).
Avida-ED extends the full-fledged Avida software, originally developed for digital evolution research, as a freely-available, interactive web application.
This web application enables laboratory activities that teach evolution through experiments with self-replicating computer programs.
A curriculum of lesson plans and classroom materials targeted to high school and university students support instructors.
Outreach and training puts these tools into hundreds of real-world classrooms.
From there, the team has used evidence-based methods to evaluate activities' effectiveness in terms of actualized learning outcomes.

Each WAVES workshop participant will collaborate with a graduate student advisor on a software development project related to Avida-ED or the underlying scientific software tools that power it.
We describe several possible project categories below.
Participants' projects will directly contribute open-source software to the foundation of future versions of Avida and Avida-ED.
To demonstrate their software, participants wil build their own prototype scientific web application/mini research project or contribute to an existing web application/research project.
As a culmination of their workshop experience and an exercise in professional communication, participants will publish a blog post describing how their software works and how to use it.

During the workshop, participants will also engage in a weekly software discussion group and a weekly group check-in meeting.

## Logistics

The virtual workshop will take place between **May 25, 2020** and **July 31, 2020**.
Participants will be expected to commit to full-time engagement with the workshop.
A $6,000 stipend will be disbursed in five bi-weekly installments (TODO double check this with Connie) to participants.

Individuals who were enrolled as an undergaduate or graduate student during the fall of 2019 or the spring of 2020 are eligible to participate.

We are seeking participants with prior practical experience in computer science: writing and running software of some sort.
Prior experience with C++ and/or JavaScript is expected, but not strictly required.
We especially encourage applications from members of underrepresented groups in computer science.

Applications should consist of:
1. a curriculum vitae or resume, and
2. a brief (appox. 500 to 1000 words) statement that describes
  * your personal background and career goals,
  * your interest in the program, and
  * an interesting coding project you've tackled.
    * in any setting: school, hackathon, personal project, research, work, etc.
    * as possible, link us to the code, the deployment, the project website, a writeup, and/or presentation!

Applications should be submitted to [ofria@msu.edu](ofria@msu.edu) with the subject line "WAVES Application"  no later than **May 4, 2020**.

We will announce paticipant selection no later than **May 11, 2020**.

This workshop is funded through NSF Grant No. TODO.

## Project Direction 1

Build core web framework tools in the [Empirical C++ library for scientific software development](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical).

Possibilities include:
* designing a unified web layout framework,
  * [https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/117](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/117)
  * example, [http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/](http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/)
* building in-browser data visualizations,
* assembling a unified run-time configuration framework
  * combining url query paramaters with UI sliders and text fields
  * e.g., [https://emilydolson.github.io/genomic_stability_model/web/genomic_stability_model.html](https://emilydolson.github.io/genomic_stability_model/web/genomic_stability_model.html)
* building a multi-canvas web visualization framework,
  * e.g., [http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/](http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/)

As part of their work, participants will assemble an example research, educational, or science communcation web application that demonstrates their software.

## Project Direction 2

Build core digital evolution framework tools in the [Modular Agent-Based Evolution (MABE) project](https://github.com/hintzelab/mabe).

Possibilities include:
* work on core MABE2
* build/port evolution modules for MABE2
* build virtual hardware systems for next-generation Avida

As part of their work, participants will assemble a mini research project that demonstrates their software.

## Project Direction 3

Work on core C++ software library tools [Empirical C++ library for scientific software development](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical)..

Possibilities include:
* build safety-checked versions of more stl containers for `base`
* [data collection tools](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/111)
* testing for the web framework
  * e.g., [automated UI testing](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/177) and [measuring coverage](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/184)
* [Write a nice interface for .tar.gz extraction (compatible with Emscripten) and package it into `emp/tools`](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/260)
* ["Small String" Performance optimizations for BitVector](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/262)
* Empirical [project template enhancements](https://github.com/devosoft/cookiecutter-empirical-project/issues)
* writing documentation

As part of their work, participants will devise a benchmarking experiment or example use-case to demonstrate their software.

## Project Direction 4

Develop novel interactive science communication or educational activities to complement existing AvidaEd curriculum.

As part of their work, participants will assemble a prototype implementation of the web tool (if necessary) and a sample lesson plan.

Possibilities include:
* putting together a hands-on digital evolution activity for local Elementary Science nights
