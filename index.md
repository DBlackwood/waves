# Call for Participants

TODO what is AvidaEd blurb should go here.
[Here's a link.](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/)

We are looking to recruite five to eight participants for an eight week funded full-time workshop.
The goal of the workshop is to familiarize participants with the software tools the next version of AvidaEd will be built on and to jumpstart software development that will support the next version of AvidaEd.

Work one-on-one with a graduate student on a project.
Project will result in a contribution to the software libraries that will power future versions of AvidaEd.
Participants will contribute a blog post describing the project, demonstrating the project, and maybe recapping the development process behind the project.

In addition to working closely one-on-one with a graduate student on the project, participants will engage in a group weekly coding meeting and a weekly group check-in.

## Logistics

Participants will be expected to engage with the workshop full time.
A $5,000 stipend will be provided to participants.

The workshop will be held virtually.
We are on East Coast time but will make every effort to accomodate the time zones of participants.

Current and recently-graduated undergaduate and graduate students are eligible to participate.
Candidates should have a working knowledge of computer science.
Participants will engage in C++ software development, but prior experience with the language isn't strictly required.
We especially encourage applications from members of underrepresented groups in computer science.

Applications should consist of:
* curriculum vitae
* 2 paragraph statement of background and interest in the program

Applications should be submitted to [TODO@msu.edu](TODO@msu.edu) by **May 1, 2020**.

This workshop is funded through NSF Grant No. TODO.

## Project Direction 1

Work on web framework tools.

As part of their work, participants may assemble an example educational or scicomm web application that demonstrates and tests their code.

Here are some potential avenues:

* web layout framework
  * [https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/117](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/117)
  * example, [http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/](http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/)
* graphs!
* unified url query parameter/slider & text box run-time configuration framework
* unified multi-canvas web framework
  * e.g., [http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/](http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/)

## Project Direction 2

Work on evolution framework tools.

As part of their work, participants may assemble an evolutionary system or research project that demonstrates and tests their code.

* work on core MABE2
* build/port evolution modules for MABE2
* build virtual evolutionary hardware

## Project Direction 3

Work on core C++ software library tools.

* build safety-checked versions of more stl containers for `base`
* [data collection tools](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/111)
* testing for the web framework
  * e.g., [automated UI testing](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/177) and [measuring coverage](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/184)
* [Write a nice interface for .tar.gz extraction (compatible with Emscripten) and package it into `emp/tools`](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/260)
* ["Small String" Performance optimizations for BitVector](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/262)
* Empirical [project template enhancements](https://github.com/devosoft/cookiecutter-empirical-project/issues)

## Project Direction 4

Develop novel interactive evolutionarly learning activities to complement existing AvidaEd curriculum.

As part of their work, participants will assemble a prototype implementation of the web tool (if necessary) and a sample lesson plan.

## Who We Are

We are the [Digital Evolution Laboratory at Michigan State University](https://devolab.org/).
We use digital model systems to study evolution.
