# Call for Participants

We are looking to recruit five to eight early-career participants for an eight-week, funded, full-time, fully-remote software development workshop during the summer of 2020.

The goal of the workshop is four-fold:
1. to help participants advance their careers by skillbuilding through hands-on software development in an academic setting,
2. to catalyze effective scicomm and science education by graduating enthusiastic participants with the know-how and intent to showcase their field and their research through interactive web applications,
3. to jumpstart software development on web framework and core digital evolution tools in support of the next versions of Avida and Avida Ed, and
4. to yield software that enriches the digital evolution, scientific, and open-source comunities more broadly.

This workshop is organized in conjunction with the [Avida Ed project](https://avida-ed.msu.edu/).
The Avida Ed project packages full-fledged Avida software, originally developed for digital evolution research, as a freely-available, interactive web application.
This web application enables laboratory activities that teach evolution through experiments with self-replicating computer programs.
A curriculum of lesson plans and classroom materials targeted to high school and university students support instructors.
Outreach and training puts these tools into real-world classrooms.
From there, the team has used evidence-based methods to evaluate activities' effectiveness in terms of actualized learning outcomes.

WAVES workshop participants will collaborate with a graduate student advisor on a software development project related to Avida Ed.
We describe several possible project categories below.
Participants' projects will contribute software to the foundation of future versions of Avida and Avida Ed.
As part of their software development project, participants will build an interactive scientific web application or mini research project that demonstrates their software.
As a culmination of their experience, participants will publish a blog post describing how their software works and how to use it.

During the workshop, participants will also engage in a weekly software discussion group and a weekly group check-in meeting.

## Logistics

The virtual workshop will take place between **TODO** and **TODO**.
Participants will be expected to commit to full-time engagement with the workshop.
A $5,000 stipend will be provided to participants.
(TODO when and how).

Individuals who were enrolled as an undergaduate or graduate student during the fall of 2019 or the spring of 2020 are eligible to participate.

We are seeking participants with prior practical experience in computer science: writing and running software of some sort.
Prior experience with C++ is especially valuable, but not strictly required.
We especially encourage applications from members of underrepresented groups in computer science.

Applications should consist of:
1. a curriculum vitae, and
2. a brief (two paragraph) personal background statement and explanation of interest in the program.

Applications should be submitted to [TODO@msu.edu](TODO@msu.edu) no later than **May 1, 2020**.

We will announce paticipant selection no later than **TODO**.

This workshop is funded through NSF Grant No. TODO.

## Project Direction 1

Build core web framework tools in the [Empirical C++ library for scientific software development](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical).

Possibilities include:
* designing a unified web layout framework,
  * [https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/117](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/117)
  * example, [http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/](http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/)
* building in-browser data visualizations,
* assembling a unified run-time configuration framework
  * combining url query paramaters with UI sliders and text fields
  * e.g., [https://emilydolson.github.io/genomic_stability_model/web/genomic_stability_model.html](https://emilydolson.github.io/genomic_stability_model/web/genomic_stability_model.html)
* building a multi-canvas web visualization framework,
  * e.g., [http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/](http://mmore500.com/dishtiny/53vgh/)

As part of their work, participants will assemble an example scientific, educational, or scicomm web application that demonstrates their software.

## Project Direction 2

Build core digital evolution framework tools in the [Modular Agent-Based Evolution (MABE) project](https://github.com/hintzelab/mabe).

Possibilities include:
* work on core MABE2
* build/port evolution modules for MABE2
* build virtual hardware systems for next-generation Avida

As part of their work, participants will assemble an evolutionary system or research project that demonstrates their software.

## Project Direction 3

Work on core C++ software library tools [Empirical C++ library for scientific software development](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical)..

Possibilities include:
* build safety-checked versions of more stl containers for `base`
* [data collection tools](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/111)
* testing for the web framework
  * e.g., [automated UI testing](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/177) and [measuring coverage](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/184)
* [Write a nice interface for .tar.gz extraction (compatible with Emscripten) and package it into `emp/tools`](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/260)
* ["Small String" Performance optimizations for BitVector](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues/262)
* Empirical [project template enhancements](https://github.com/devosoft/cookiecutter-empirical-project/issues)
* writing documentation

As part of their work, participants will devise a benchmarking experiment or example use-case to demonstrate their software.

## Project Direction 4

Develop novel interactive scicomm or educational activities to complement existing AvidaEd curriculum.

As part of their work, participants will assemble a prototype implementation of the web tool (if necessary) and a sample lesson plan.

Possibilities include:
* put together a hands-on digital evolution activity for local Elementary Science nights
  * perhaps making use of BEACON's nifty travel projector?

## Who We Are

We are the [Digital Evolution Laboratory at Michigan State University](https://devolab.org/).
We use digital evolution systems to study the process of evolution and solve engineering problems.
