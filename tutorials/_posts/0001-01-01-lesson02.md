## Native C++ Compiler Install

![dragon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gifcities-dragonflowing.gif){:width="100%"}

In the Unix-verse (e.g., Linux / MacOS) commonly used compilers include GCC and Clang.
From this point onwards, we assume that you're working with GCC.
So, you'll want to have GCC installed.
The good news is: you might already!

Bring up a terminal and try entering:

```
which gcc
```

If which spits out a path, then you have GCC installed!
If which says "not found," you'll need to go ahead and install GCC.
For Linux users, your package manager (e.g., yum, apt, etc.) is probably the way to go about this.
For MacOS users, you'll need to get Apple's "Command Line Tools for Xcode."
Either way, give it a quick web search (e.g., "install GCC on [my operating system]") and there should be plenty of how-to guides that walk you through step-by-step.

Because Empirical uses C++17 features, you'll want GCC version 7 or better available.
You can check your GCC version with `gcc --version`.

For Windows, you'll want to try this all with the Unix subsystem.

## Hello, World!

![code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gifcities-code.gif){:width="100%"}

Assuming you haven't already pulled down a clone of Empirical, let's get your working environment all set.

```
git clone https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical
```

Let's make some starter code.

`main.cc`
```
#include <iostream>
#include "tools/Random.h"

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
  emp::Random rand();
  std::cout << rand.GetDouble() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "haha lol wut so random" << std::endl;
}
```

This part is where some Empirical source is brought in.
```
#include "tools/Random.h"
```

We print "Hello World!".
Then we use an Empirical's tool to sample a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1.

Let's compile!

```
g++ -std=c++17 -I../Empirical/source -o hello
```

If you `ls`, you should now see that the executable `hello` has been created.
Let's run!

```
./hello
```

## Your first evolutionary algorithm

![dna]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gifcities-dna.gif){:width="100%"}

Now that you are all set up, it is a good idea to get started on your first *digital evolution* program.
Not only will this help you get used to the codebase and how to deal with it, but it will also point out any problems that your installation of Empirical or GCC (or Clang if you're fancy) might have.
This will save a lot of headaches in the future!

In this tutorial, we are going to be evolving a *population* into approximating a *fitness function* by using *tournament selection.*

These terms will sound more natural in a couple weeks, but right now we need to have a simple notion of what they mean.

A population is generally understood to be a collection of specimens.
In this case, our population is going to be represented by floating point numbers in a vector.
Initially, these numbers will be random, and we will be tuning them so that they approximate a function.

A fitness function is a way to express how close a population is to a goal.
Given that our goal is approximating a given function f(x), that will simply be our fitness function.

A selection scheme is an algorithm to determine which individuals will progress to the next generation.
In the case of tournament selection, we will be sampling randomly from the population, and then finding the best-fit individual in that sample.


First, let's `cd` into the Project Template directory again.

```
cd Empirical/examples/ProjectTemplate
```

Now, let's copy our template into another file. That way we get to rename it and keep the original template in place for future projects.

```
cp source/native/project_name.cc source/native/evoalgo.cc
```
Let's fix the headers to include things that we will actually need.
From the Standard Template Library (STL) we will be using `<cmath>` for our fitness function, and `<algorithm>` to find the winner of our tournament selection.
From the Empirical library, we will be making use of the Random header for the initial generation of our population, the selection scheme, and mutations. We will also be using the DataFile header for logging.
Knowing all of this, our headers should look like:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

#include "base/vector.h"
#include "config/command_line.h"
#include "tools/random_utils.h"
#include "tools/Random.h"
#include "data/DataFile.h"
```

Inside main(), we will start by initializing constants and variables.

```
const size_t population_size = 50;
const size_t gens = 100;
size_t curr_gen = 0;
```

Here, `population_size` is the number of individuals our population will have—basically, the size of our vector.
`gens` is the number of generations we will be iterating through—how long our experiment will last for, and `curr_gen` represents the current generation.

We will also want to create a vector to store our individuals, and initialize it with random values.

```
// vector to store our values of x
emp::vector<double> population;

// make random engine
emp::Random rand(-1);

// randomize population
population = emp::RandomDoubleVector(
  rand,
  population_size,
  0,
  2
);
```

Even though there is no reason to do so in this case, it is good to get used to using `emp::vector` in place of `std::vector` throughout your C++ code.
`emp::vector` has a more extended debugging functionality than its STL counterpart when in debug mode (for example, it you can use the `<<` operator on it). When in release mode, it is the same as a `std::vector`.

Next, we have to initialize the logging, since we want to generate a .csv file to then graph in Python.
Let's start by making a container that will run a function each time we want to update the logging file—`ContainerDataFile`.

```
auto datafile = emp::MakeContainerDataFile(
  std::function<emp::vector<double>()>{
    [&population](){ return population; }
  },
  "evoalgo.csv"
);
```

There are a lot of new things going on in that snippet of code, so let's try to unravel it.
The `auto` keyword tells the compiler to deduce the type.
This way, we can be lazy and not spend valuable seconds trying to figure out what that function returns.
The first parameter is the function we want to run every time the `Update()` method gets called.
In this case, it is a lambda function that just returns the population.
The second parameter is the filename we will be writing to.

Now, let's add the variables to track.

```
datafile.AddVar(
  curr_gen,
  "generation",
  "Current Generation"
);

datafile.AddContainerFun(
  std::function<double(double)>{[](double x){
    return x;
  }},
  "genome",
  "Current Genome"
);

datafile.AddContainerFun(
  std::function<double(double)>{[](double x){
    return CalcFitness(x);
  }},
  "fitness",
  "Current Fitness"
);
```
In this case, the `generation` column records the current generation, `genome` keeps track of the values of our population, and `fitness` is the fitness of that genome.
Thus, each row is an individual in the population, so we will have `population_size` individuals per generation.

We will also want to print the names of these variables for the header, and record the initial state of our population. We can do that with

```
datafile.PrintHeaderKeys();
datafile.Update();
```

## Fitness and tournaments

If you have a keen eye, you might have noticed we invoked a function that we haven't yet defined, `CalcFitness()`.
This function will calculate the fitness of an individual.
It should take in a `const`ant reference to a `double`, and return the fitness for that value.
For the purposes of this tutorial, we want a function with different local and absolute maxima, but that is also easy to calculate and graph.
This sounds like a job for the sinusoidal family of functions!
Maybe something like,

$$
f(x) = \sin(2 \theta) + \sin(6 \theta) + \sin(10 \theta) - \cos(\theta)
$$

Sounds easy enough; let's implement it!

```
double CalcFitness(const double& x) {
	return std::sin(2 * x) + std::sin(6.0 * x) + std::sin(10.0 * x) - std::cos(x);
}
```

Before continuing, we should also implement the tournament selection scheme.

```
double DoTournament(const emp::vector<double>& pool, emp::Random& rand, size_t n = 7) { }
```

Inside this function, we are going to want a vector to the randomly-selected individuals that will enter our tournament, and then another vector with random ints that will be the indices of the organisms we will select. I know this sounds complicated, but in reality, the code is very simple:

```
emp::vector<double> selected;

emp::vector<size_t> choices = emp::Choose(
  rand,
  pool.size(),
  n
);
```

Following this, we need to populate the `selected` vector with the tournament "contestants." Something like this will work:

```
for (const size_t& x: choices) {
  selected.push_back(pool[x]);
}
```

Now we need to find the winner! We will do so by using an algorithm from STL's `<algorithm>` (duh), `std::max_element()`!
Our very helpful IDE tells us that this function takes in an iterator pointing to the beginning of the vector, then another one pointing to its end, and then optionally, a callable that takes in two elements and returns whether the first one is "smaller" than the second.
Since we want to find the element with the greater fitness, we will be making use of this.

```
double winner = *std::max_element(
  selected.begin(),
  selected.end(),
  [](const double& a, const double& b) {
    return CalcFitness(a) < CalcFitness(b);
  }
);
```

All that's left from our selection scheme is actually returning the winner.

```
return winner;
```

That was easy!
Just to recap, our DoTournament() function now looks like,

```
double DoTournament(const emp::vector<double>& pool, emp::Random& rand, size_t n = 7) {
	emp::vector<double> selected;

	emp::vector<size_t> choices = emp::Choose(
		rand,
		pool.size(),
		n
	);

	for (const size_t& x: choices) {
		selected.push_back(pool[x]);
	}

	double winner = *std::max_element(
		selected.begin(),
		selected.end(),
		[](const double& a, const double& b) {
			return CalcFitness(a) < CalcFitness(b);
		}
	);

	return winner;
}
```

## Let's evolve!

Alas, now we can finally get into the "evolutionary" part of our evolutionary algorithm.
Let us, then, go back to our `main()` and add a loop that iterates through all generations.

```
for (size_t t = 0; t < gens; ++t) {	}
```

Inside this loop, we are going to first create a vector to store the population that the following generation will use.

```
emp::vector<double> next_population;
```

We will now iterate through the current population vector, do a tournament for every of its individuals, and store the result in the next generation's population
(note: this doesn't mean that particular individual will get selected. It just means the new population will have as many individuals as the last. By the end some (read, most) will be repeated.)

```
// select individuals for next generation
for (size_t i = 0; i < population_size; ++i) {
  double winner = DoTournament(
    population,
    rand,
    3
  );
  next_population.push_back(winner);
}
```

We also want to apply a mutation to some of our individuals.
Let's say the probability that an individual mutates is 25%.

```
  for (double& ind : next_population) {
    if (rand.P(0.25)) {
      ind += rand.GetDouble(-1.0, 1.0);
    }
  }
```

All in all, this snippet means that there is a 25% chance that each individual mutates, and this mutation will be a random double in [-1, 1].

Finally, we are going to set our current population to this new population, increase the generation counter for our log file, and update the log.

```
population = next_population;
++curr_gen;

datafile.Update();
```

The full code is available [here](LINK).

## Running our code

Now, we need to edit our Makefile to correctly compile our project.
Let's use `nano` for that.
Assuming you are still in the same directory (and why shouldn't you be?) the command to run is:

```
nano Makefile
```

Be careful if you are using Linux because capitalization *does* matter in filenames.


There, the second line will say

```
PROJECT := project_name
```

Let's replace that with

```
PROJECT := evoalgo
```

Now, press `ctrl + o` and then `return` to save, and `ctrl + x` to exit.

Finally, we can run

```
make && ./evoalgo
```

To run and execute our program.
If any errors pop up, first double check your copy-pasted code, and then try the linked version above.
If that still fails, please contact your mentor and tell them there is a problem with your C++ or Empirical installation.

There will be a file named `evoalgo.csv` in your current directory.
Let's hope over to Repl.it, where we have set up an online Python script to graph your data.

## Graphing results

![graph]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gifcities-graph.gif){:width="100%"}

[Click here to open the graphing script.](https://repl.it/@rodsan0/WhisperedGrimArchitect#main.py)

We will first click on the 'evoalgo.csv' on the left side of the screen, and we will paste the contents of our file here.
Next, we will go back to 'main.py' and click the green 'run' button at the top.
This will take a couple of minutes.
After it's done, we can go to the 'images' directory to appreciate the fruits of our labor.
