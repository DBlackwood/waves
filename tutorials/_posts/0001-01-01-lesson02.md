## Native C++ Compiler Install

In the Unix-verse (e.g., Linux / MacOS) commonly used compilers include GCC and Clang.
From this point onwards, we assume that you're working with GCC.
So, you'll want to have GCC installed.
The good news is: you might already!

Bring up a terminal and try entering:

```
which gcc
```

If which spits out a path, then you have GCC installed!
If which says "not found," you'll need to go ahead and install GCC.
For Linux users, your package manager (e.g., yum, apt, etc.) is probably the way to go about this.
For MacOS users, you'll need to get Apple's "Command Line Tools for Xcode."
Either way, give it a quick web search (e.g., "install GCC on [my operating system]") and there should be plenty of how-to guides that walk you through step-by-step.

Because Empirical uses C++17 features, you'll want GCC version 7 or better available.
You can check your GCC version with `gcc --version`.

For Windows, you'll want to try this all with the Unix subsystem.

## Hello, World!

Assuming you haven't already pulled down a clone of Empirical, let's get your working environment all set.

```
git clone https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical
```

Let's make some starter code.

`main.cc`
```
#include <iostream>
#include "tools/Random.h"

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
  emp::Random rand();
  std::cout << rand.GetDouble() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "haha lol wut so random" << std::endl;
}
```

This part is where some Empirical source is brought in.
```
#include "tools/Random.h"
```

We print "Hello World!".
Then we use an Empirical's tool to sample a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1.

Let's compile!

```
g++ -std=c++17 -I../Empirical/source -o hello
```

If you `ls`, you should now see that the executable `hello` has been created.
Let's run!

```
./hello
```
