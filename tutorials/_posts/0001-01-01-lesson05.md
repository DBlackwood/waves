## Empirical (native)

* data collection tools
  * mentors: Alex, Emily
* unit testing
  * mentor: Matthew
* safety-wrapped containers for base
  * mentor: Emily
* package `.tar.gz` extraction functionality
  * mentor: Matthew
* systematics
  * cleanup & merge existing branch versions of systematics
  * develop more phylogeny tracking features
  * mentors: Alex, Emily

## Empirical (web)

* wrap a JavaScript framework
  * exploratory work
  * especially charting e.g., d3 or chart.js
  * maybe reveal.js or three.js
  * mentors: Alex, Emily
* fix existing d3 wrapper
  * mentors: Alex, Austin, Emily
* unified run-time configuration framework
  * [example](https://emilydolson.github.io/genomic_stability_model/web/genomic_stability_model.htm)
  * mentors: Emily, Matthew
* measuring test coverage on web framework
  * mentor: Emily
* wrapper for a bootstrap-based layout manager
  * mentors: Matthew, Alex

## Apps

* phylogeny viewer (data standards)
  * mentors: Alex, Austin, Emily, Cliff
* config editor
  * mentors: Austin, Jory, Cliff
* implement a web interface for an existing project
  * w/a brief explanation/science communication bit
  * e.g., SignalGP genetic regulation, selection scheme demos, classic evo bio models, most existing Avida papers
  * maybe in conjunction with wrapping a JS library in Empirical
  * write useful documentation and guides along the way
  * mentors: Alex, Emily

## MABE

* MABE concepts, tutorials, packaged lesson configs, edu animations
  * design tutorials for people to use MABE that focus on self-directed exploration of the software
  * targeted at biology students
  * e.g. “comp sci for biologists” vs. “biology for computer scientists”
  * mentors: Acacia, Cliff, Jory

## Virtual Hardwware

* SignalGP
  * more module types (markov brains, neutral networks, tree-based gp, etc.)
  * code improvements/refactoring
  * web interface for running a visual trace of a SignalGP CPU
  * asynchronous execution
  * mentor: Alex
* PushGP
  * mentor: Alex

## Avida-ED 4

* mobile-friendly modifications
  * mentor: Diane
* language dictionaries
* so that the text on Avida-ED 4 can be displayed in languages other than English
  * mentor: Diane

## Symbulation

* JS UI of Symbulation symbionts
  * mentor: Anya
* Modularize Symbulation so genomes can be switched out easily
  * mentor: Anya
* Symbulation with Avida-style genomes
  * mentor: Anya
